# ionic-6-test

This is my test for latest Ionic 6, and I wanted try Cloudflare CI because it's free. Except for some settings for Node.JS version,
it worked. View demo at

[https://ionic-6-test.pages.dev/](https://ionic-6-test.pages.dev/)

The demo is about quick ICD10 search. You can search diagnosis code typing some keywords. No backend.

I converted ICD10 xml file which you can download from https://www.cms.gov/medicare/icd-10/2022-icd-10-cm.

You can see actual script in convert.html.
